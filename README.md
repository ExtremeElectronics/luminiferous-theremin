Theremin made with two time of flight (TOF) sensors and a Pi Pico

The two TOF sensors give Volume and Frequency controls
An audio out channel via DMA and PWM and the creation of sounds using a simple wavetable synth.

### Still a Work in Progress :)

## What is a Luminiferous Theremin?

Although this is technically a “light” theremin, it doesn’t use a photo cell or photo transistor to detect light, but two laser distance measuring devices called Time of Flight (TOF) sensors. The Time of flight sensors replace the two ariels seen on traditional theremin and allow a number of improvements over the older theremin devices. Because the two sensors reply on laser light, the areas of sensitivity are tightly controlled, allowing a smaller separation between pitch and volume, this enables the sensors to be in the same plane and therefore allows the Luminiferous Theremin to be a table top device, rather than mounted on a stand. As the laser time of flight sensors are entirely digital in operation, there is no calibration required and the distance to pitch is millimetre accurate, so when the device is moved and the position of the notes will be accurately repeated every time.
The Synthesiser

The Luminiferous Theremin contains a simple wave table synthesiser pre programmed with 16 different voices that are controlled by the operators hands (actually, any part of the body will do)

Currently the voices are Sine, Square, Triangle, Square2, Sawtooth, Organ, Trumpet, Clarinet, Bassoon, Flute, Spinet, Organ2, Harp, BigLead, Trombone, Musicbox.

There are also a number of effects that can be selected, Normal , Note Only – Forces the pitch to a “real” note , Wobulate (Slow, Medium,Fast) – vary the pitch with a sign wave.
Connections

The output of the theremin is either via a line out (1vpk) 3.5mm socket, ideal for connecting to external speakers or mixing desks, or via a small internal speaker, ideal for practice, but not very loud.

The state of the theremin is displayed at all times on  a small OLED display

The Theremin is powered by 5V provided from a standard micro USB connector.

## The Kit

The Luminiferous Theremin Kit comes with a complete set of parts Acrylic case, display, PCB, 2 TOF sensors, a pre-programmed PI Pico and a hand full of small components.
